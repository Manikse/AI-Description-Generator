# Kairos AI
## MVP of Kairos AI(or untill now AI-Description-Generator) is a lightweight yet powerful AI-powered tool designed to automatically generate high-quality descriptions, READMEs, and documentation for any project.
It is fully optimized for deployment on Netlify Functions and integrates seamlessly with OpenRouter API, making it ideal as a micro-service or standalone content generator.

## Why This Project Is Useful:
✅ Instant documentation — no more spending hours writing descriptions manually.
🌐 Effortless deployment — runs on Netlify without additional server setup.
🔄 Flexible API integration — easily plug it into your apps, scripts, or CI/CD pipelines.
🛠 Universal usage — works for web projects, scripts, SaaS apps, microservices, and more.

## How It Works
1.Deploy the repository to Netlify.
2.Add your OpenRouter API key to environment variables.
3.Send a request to the serverless function with:
  project code
  a short summary
  optional custom parameters
4.Receive a clean, well-structured description suitable for README files, documentation, or portfolio content.

## Example Use Case
Input: Repository code + summary
Output: Professionally formatted project description including:
